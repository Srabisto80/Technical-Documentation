    <!-- User Story #1: I can see a main element with a corresponding id="main-doc", 
    which contains the page's main content (technical documentation). 
    User Story #2: Within the #main-doc element, I can see several section 
    elements, each with a class of main-section. There should be a minimum of 5. 
    User Story #3: The first element within each .main-section should be a header 
    element which contains text that describes the topic of that section. 
    User Story #4: Each section element with the class of main-section should 
    also have an id that corresponds with the text of each header contained 
    within it. Any spaces should be replaced with underscores (e.g. The section 
    that contains the header "JavaScript and Java" should have a corresponding 
    id="JavaScript_and_Java"). 
    User Story #5: The .main-section elements should contain at least 10 p 
    elements total (not each). 
    User Story #6: The .main-section elements should contain at least 5 code 
    elements total (not each). 
    User Story #7: The .main-section elements should contain at least 5 li items 
    total (not each). 
    User Story #8: I can see a nav element with a corresponding id="navbar". 
    User Story #9: The navbar element should contain one header element which 
    contains text that describes the topic of the technical documentation. 
    User Story #10: Additionally, the navbar should contain link (a) elements 
    with the class of nav-link. There should be one for every element with the 
    class main-section. 
    User Story #11: The header element in the navbar must come before any link 
    (a) elements in the navbar. 
    User Story #12: Each element with the class of nav-link should contain text 
    that corresponds to the header text within each section (e.g. if you have a 
    "Hello world" section/header, your navbar should have an element which 
    contains the text "Hello world"). 
    User Story #13: When I click on a navbar element, the page should navigate 
    to the corresponding section of the main-doc element (e.g. If I click on a 
    nav-link element that contains the text "Hello world", the page navigates to 
    a section element that has that id and contains the corresponding header. 
    User Story #14: On regular sized devices (laptops, desktops), the element 
    with id="navbar" should be shown on the left side of the screen and should 
    always be visible to the user. 
    User Story #15: My Technical Documentation page should use at least one media 
    query. Once you're done, submit the URL to your working project with all its 
    tests passing. -->

            <p>A robot is a machine--especially one programmable by a computer--capable of 
                carrying out a complex series of actions automatically.  A robot can be guided by
                an external control device, or the control may be embedded within.  Robots may 
                be constructed to evoke human form, but most robots are task-performing machines, designed with an emphasis on 
                stark functionality, rather than expressive aesthetics.</p>

            <p>'Robot' was first applied as a term for artificial automata in the 1920 play RUR by the Czech writer,
                Karl Capek.  However, Josef capek was named by his brother Karel as the tru inventor
                of the term robot. The word 'robot' itself was not new, having been in the Slavic language as <i>robota</i> 
                (forced labor), a term applied to peasants obligated to compulsory service under the feudal system.

            <p>One of the first humanoid robots, Eric, was exhibited in 1928 at the annual
                exhibition of the Model Engineers Society in London, where it delivered a speech. The robot's 
                frame consisted of an aluminium body of armour with elven electromagnets and one motor powered
                 by a twelve-volt power source. <code>button</code></p>
            <p>Televox was built in 1926 by Westinghouse Electric Corporation.  It was a cardboard cutout connected to various devices which users could trun on and off.  In 1939, the humanoid robot known as Elektro
                was debuted at the 1939 New York World's Fair. Japan's first robot, Gakutensoku, was
                designed and constructed by biologist Makoto Nishimura.</p>

            </div>
            <p>Remotely operated vehicles were demonstrated in the late 19th century in the form of several types
                of remotely controlled torpedoes. The Brennan topedo, invented by Louis Brennan in 1877, was powered by two <code>contra-rotating</code>
            propellors that were spun by rapidly pulling out wires from drums wound inside the torpedo.  Differential speed on 
            the wires connected to the shore station allowed the torpedo to be guided to its target, making it "the 
            world's first <i>practical</i> guided missile."</p>
